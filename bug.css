The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` can produce unexpected results when dealing with dynamically generated content or content that changes frequently. The `n` value in `:nth-child(n)` is evaluated against the rendered DOM tree, not necessarily the source code. Therefore, if the DOM tree changes due to JavaScript manipulation or other processes, the `:nth-child(n)` selector may not apply to the elements you expect.
